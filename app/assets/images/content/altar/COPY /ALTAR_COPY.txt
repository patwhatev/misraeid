Altar Exhibitions is a non-stationary curatorial project by Nikki Mirsaeid and Taj Robinson; funded by Southern Exposure Alternative Exposure grant. The project seeks to locate unconventional spaces as exhibition venues. Place such as, but not limited to, an Episcopal church, a vacant gas station, an abandoned storefront, and so on. They cultivated a community of artists that go beyond the confines of the gallery environment and activate unrealized territory. Altar Exhibitions insists on reappropriating space--making theretofore inaccessible space reachable. Altar Exhibitions are never contained between four white walls. Instead, their locales are fundamental lenses for reading and connecting to objects, installations, and performances.
