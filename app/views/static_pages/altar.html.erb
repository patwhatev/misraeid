    <h2>Altar Exhibitions is a non-stationary curatorial project by Nikki Mirsaeid and Taj Robinson; funded by Southern Exposure Alternative Exposure grant. 
    The project seeks to locate unconventional spaces as exhibition venues.
    Place such as, but not limited to, an Episcopal church, a vacant gas 
    station, an abandoned storefront, and so on. They cultivated a community
    of artists that go beyond the confines of the gallery environment and 
    activate unrealized territory. Altar Exhibitions insists on 
    reappropriating space--making theretofore inaccessible space 
    reachable. Altar Exhibitions are never contained between four 
    white walls. Instead, their locales are fundamental lenses for 
    reading and connecting to objects, installations, and performances. </h2>
